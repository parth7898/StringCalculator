# StringCalculator

StringCalculator is a Ruby library that performs calculations on strings containing numbers. It supports various delimiters, custom delimiters, and handles invalid input gracefully.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alkeshrails/StringCalculator.git

```

## Usage
Main class is ```StringCalculator``` but to assume ```Runner``` class as a wrapper.

Navigate to the project directory and run the runner.rb script using Ruby:

```ruby
ruby runner.rb ""              # will return 0
ruby runner.rb "1"             # will return 1
```
Return sum of comma separated numbers:
```ruby
ruby runner.rb "1,2"             # will return 3
ruby runner.rb "1,2,3"           # will return 6
```


Allow the add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).

The following input is valid: ```1\n2,3``` (will return 6)
The following input is invalid: ```1,\n```

```ruby
ruby runner.rb "1\n2\n3"       # will return 6
```
For Invalid Inputs:
```ruby
ruby runner.rb "1,2,"          # will raise error Invalid Input
ruby runner.rb "1,2\n"         # will raise error Invalid Input
ruby runner.rb "\n1,2"         # will raise error Invalid Input
```

Also use custom delimiter:

To change delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: ```//[delimiter]\n[numbersâ€¦]```, for example ```//;\n1;2``` here the delimiter is ```;``` and this should return ```3```.
```ruby
ruby runner.rb "//;\n1;2;3,4\n5"   # will give sum of 1,2,3,4 and 5 which is 15.
```

## Features
Handles empty strings gracefully, returning 0.
Supports single numbers, returning the number itself.
Supports comma-separated numbers and newline-separated numbers, returning their sum.
Supports custom delimiters specified in the input string.
Raises ArgumentError for invalid input, such as negative numbers or empty spaces between numbers.


## Examples

#### Single number
```ruby
ruby runner.rb "5"  # Output: 5
```

#### Comma-separated numbers
```ruby
ruby runner.rb "1,2,3" # Output: 6
```

#### Newline-separated numbers
```ruby
ruby runner.eb "1\n2\n3" # Output: 6
```

#### Custom delimiter specified in input
```ruby
ruby runner.rb "//;\n1;2;3" # Output: 6
```

#### For Invalid String
```ruby
ruby runner.rb "1,2," # Output: Error: Invalid Input
ruby runner.rb ",1,2" # Output: Error: Invalid Input
ruby runner.rb "\n1,2," # Output: Error: Invalid Input
```

#### For Negative Numbers String
```ruby
ruby runner.rb "1,-2,-3,4"
Output: Error: Negative numbers not allowed: -2, -3
```
